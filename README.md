## Summary

My exercises and run time details while working through classic-computer-science-problems-in-python.

Most of code here is from the textbook examples, although I have 
explored a few simple variations. I've also added a README.md to each subfolder with some execution notes and personal interpretation of the example    .

The code here is also using a python3.9 feature "Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections".

The default python3 version for Ubuntu16.04 is 3.5

```
[~/projects/classic-problems-python/chap1-small-problems/Compression] # lsb_release -d
Description:	Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
[~/projects/classic-problems-python/chap1-small-problems/Compression] # python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
```

so to avoid you'll need to upgrade to 3.9


```
[~/projects/classic-problems-python/chap1-small-problems/Compression] # python3.9 --version
Python 3.9.1
```
